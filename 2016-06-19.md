#Week 5 - Reflection
##Wow, I can't believe I've made it this far!
  We are five weeks in and I am accessing foursquare's API...and know what an
  API is.  I remember reading, briefly, about API when I was studying MySQL at
  school but I didn't know what it was.  Now I know.  It is basically a way that
  companies provide for people to interact with their database.  How cool is that?
  We can write code to interact with a company's database.  Each company does this
  in a different way, so they provide documentation for you to understand how to
  do that.
##Over the past five weeks, there have been a few challenges.
  I feel pretty good with HTML.  I feel good with JavaScript.  One of the main
  challenges for me has been CSS.  It is finicky.  You really need to pay attention
  to where things are in the cascade.  One thing that has helped me, recently,
  has been Susy.  It does a lot of calculations and helps when you are building
  grids.  Susy is fantastic for helping to place elements on a page.  I'm still
  just scratching the surface of this amazing tool but I am loving it so far.
  Overcoming the challenge is just a matter of continuing to stretch myself with
  Susy and learn as much as I can.
