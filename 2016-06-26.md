##Halfway Point
  So, we are halfway through with the 12-week bootcamp and have only three more weeks of formal instruction.
  This week, we pretty much reviewed what we'd previously learned and got a chance to hone our skills more.
  The weekend project was an appointment app that incorporated a new topic that we covered on Thursday...local storage.
  ###Local storage is basically a way to turn a user's computer into somewhat of a database, albeit a minimal one.
  Local storage is what web designers use to tell if a user has visited a website for the first time and offer
  first time promos.  It is also a way, as we found out in our weekend project, to link two or more html pages and
  temporarily store the data that a user enters.  I imagine this is what stores like Walmart do when you add an items
  to your cart.  Then, when you checkout, your items in local storage are populated and the data is ultimately sent
  to an actual database.
##Well, this coming week, we learn Angular.
  Can't wait...I think.
