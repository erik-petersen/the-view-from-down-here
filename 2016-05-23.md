##The two types of mindsets are the fixed mindset and the growth mindset.
People with a fixed mindset believe that you are what you are and that is all you will ever be for the most part.  They believe that a person is either gifted at something or they are not.  Therefore, they will only seek situations that will prove and reinforce
their feeling of giftedness.  These people avoid challenges.

###People with a growth mindset believe that your success comes from hard work.
They look at challenges and failures as growing opportunities.

###I am a mixture of the two.  With singing, I believe that training will only get you so far.  I lead a choir and
know that some people just have the gift and some do not in spite of their years of training.
However, even if you are gifted at singing, you need training and you need to be stretched in order to improve.  You will never get better if you never get out of your comfort zone and take a class or perform at a coffee house.  Using the singing analogy, the ones who make it big are the ones who failed for years as they sang in bars.  They opened themselves up to critique and worse.

##I do believe that with whatever you do, you need to work hard at it and not be afraid of failure.
Obviously with The Iron Yard, we will constantly be out of our comfort zone and will not always be proving our intelligence.  At times, our only proof of intelligence will be the fact that we are pressing on.  It's good to know that we can fail.  It will help me to realize that as I fail, I am learning.  As I tell my choir members, if you are going to mess up, do it loudly.  We can't fix something if it isn't brought to the forefront.
