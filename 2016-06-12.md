You're going to write another tutorial topic this week. It should have something to do with jQuery and include a few demonstration code snippets. As always, your entry is due next Monday.

##Well, it just got real this week!
  This week, we began working with APIs.  At first, I had no idea what they even
  were.  I thought that they were strictly a bunch of owner's manual type documents.
  They are so much more, though.  APIs allow developers to actually use databases
  from companies like Github, Etsy, and even Best Buy.  We can use them in our apps!
  This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for apps!
  ###One way we incorporated jQuery this week was in connecting to the API using AJAX.
     No, not the cleaning agent.  AJAX is a streamlined way of making GET and POST
     requests but it is still JavaScript at the core.  It allows you to change
     information on a webpage without having to refresh the page like we used to
     have to do.  Google maps is a great example of its use.  Speaking of examples,
     here is a little code to demonstrate:

     ####Here we are going to make a POST request to a server(We want to store something on the server).
         First, we specify that this is an AJAX call.  Then we pass some information along.  HTTP has to
         know if we are getting or saving information.  We also need to have a website to get information
         from or store information to.  Either way, we specify the data that needs to be sent.  We send
         name and value pairs separated by commas.
         $.ajax({
           method: "POST",
           url: 'http://74be7da1.ngrok.io/recommendations',
           data: { "username": plockUser, "password": plockPassword,     
                   "bookmark_id":Array.from(bookmarksReceived)[index].id,
                   "recipient":"erikpetersen"
                 }
         }) // end ajax POST
     ####After the POST, if everything was successful, you have a section to decide what to do
         in that case.  In this particular case, I am grabbing three text boxes, and basically
         deleting any information inside them, if my POST was successful.  Then a user can user
         those boxes again without having to delete anything before typing.
         .success(function() {
           $( "#NewBookMarkName" ).val("");
           $( "#NewBookMarkURL" ).val("");
           $( "#NewBookMarkDescription" ).val("");
         }) // end .success
##The other big change this week was that we started working in pairs.
  This was rough at first!!!  I am the kind of person who needs to plan out what I'm going to
  do.  I write pseudo code, I draw a wireframe of what I want the page to look like including
  deciding on the proper semantic elements to use in the HTML.  My first partner was not this
  kind of a person.  He just jumped right in and started coding.  It was outgoing and take
  charge vs reserved and non-confrontational.  I had no opportunity to understand what we were
  doing and was really feeling hopeless.
  ###The combination of this and learning APIs really was rough.  Talking about it later with
     the TA and professor made me feel much better about it and I was able to suggest that we
     work on some things separately.  This made things go much better and I was able to
     understand the material.
  ###The weekend project included the backend Ruby class.  I really enjoyed it.  Having a
     degree in Database Design, I loved getting to learn what they were doing and how the
     things we did affected and looked to them.  My classes came back with warm memories.
     Our team planned very well before coding and we really tried to understand each other.
     I must say, we really did not have much problem connecting to the API that the Ruby class
     created.  They did a very good job setting it up and communicated very well.
