##Ok, so this week was actually much better for me than last week.
  I am new to html and css.  For a long time, I thought that my degree in
  database design was a waste of time.  Wake Tech did not help me at all in
  searching for a job, but I feel that I would not be able to keep up with this
  pace without the introduction and experience with programming languages and
  OOP principles.
##An important thing we learned this week was about accessing DOM elements.
  Our weekend project introduced us to toggle and the art of turning on and
  turning off css properties by targeting html elements using javascript and
  then changing the html class values.
##Looking forward to learning jQuery this coming week and getting more experience
  with HTML and CSS!
