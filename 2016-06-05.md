#This week...jquery
##So, we started learning jQuery this week.
  At this point in time, I actually like JavaScript better.  I think I am one
  of the few in that boat.  JavaScript is just more how I tend to think, though
  I admit that it takes more code than jQuery to accomplish the same thing.
  Fortunately, you can intermingle the two very easily.  We revisited code that
  we had done the previous week in JavaScript and did it using jQuery as much
  as possible.  We also started learning about modals and the importance of
  using this necessary evil.
##Another subject we began discussing was responsive web design.
  Ok, it's new to me, though I love it and plan to dive deep into its nuances.  
  This will, no doubt, require a lot of tenacity on my part because I still
  wholeheartedly admit that I stink at CSS.  Yes, I have noticed improvement in
  my CSS skills but I have a long way to go.  I actually spent the first day of
  our weekend project just getting the HTML and CSS all set up because I knew that
  it would take me much longer than the jQuery...and it did.  Normally, I would
  do minimal HTML and CSS before I knew that all the functionality was there.  The
  important thing for me is that I do notice improvement.  I like the fact that
  we get practice every week with the structure and the presentation.  I'm liking
  the program.
