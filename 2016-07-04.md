#July 4th, 2016
##So, I've never worked on July 4th and I hope this isn't a trend.
  After Christmas, this is my favorite holiday.  But, I'm still getting to enjoy
  grilling out and do some of the things I like to do on this day.  I guess one
  way to think about it is that I am fighting my way for freedom against
  unemployment.
##We began Angular this week.  The Norwegians have a word for this: "Uffda".
  I am not much of a fan of it, at the moment, but am sure will come to love it
  with time.  As a classmate pointed out, I am someone who enjoys digging down
  and seeing all the parts and manipulating the parts.  Angular covers up a lot
  of these parts.  The good part is that once Angular and I are friends, I'm sure
  it will make things much faster and easier.  I just have to keep fighting...much
  like our forefathers fought against tyranny.  Ok, very different but I was
  trying to tie two together.  Next week: Etsy...and more Angular.  For now, back
  to celebrating the birth of our nation...I think pie is involved.
